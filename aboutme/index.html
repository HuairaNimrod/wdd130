        <h2>Nim</h2>
        <p>Hello everyone!, My Name is Nimrod Huaira. On last August I got 3 years of married. I'm from Peru, but I'm currently living in Rexburg.</p>
        <p>My major is Software Engineering. During pandemic I was working in the Mobile Aplication Development field, many of the things we did there were related with web design too. I considered that these course will help me to improve my programming skills, because &quot; out of small things proceedeth that which is great&quot;.     </p>
        <p>I was baptize on 2011, and some time after I served as full-time missionary in the Uruguay-Montevideo Mission. My favorite scripture is in Ether 12:27, I know for sure that weak things can become strong unto us if we put our trust in the Lord. </p>
        <p>I wish you all a nice semester&excl;</p>
